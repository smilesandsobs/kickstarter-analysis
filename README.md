# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This is an analysis of 4112 different kickstarter fundraising campaigns around the work and how sucessful they were with relation to launch date and fundraising goals. 


### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide Louise, who just recently completed an unsuccessful campaign for her play Fever, with information on how different campaigns have done so that she can use that information as she wishes. This information could provide her with insight for planning her next kickstarter campaign.   

## Analysis and Challenges
We provided two analysis. 
One looking at how many sucessful/failed and canceled campains for plays there were during different months. 
Another looking at what percentage of campaigns were sucessful at different goaled amounts, from $1,000 to $50,000.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the data and looking at the line point. There seems to be a large correlation of successful play campaigns whose launched date begins in May. The largest number of campaigns were in May, however the percentage of successful campaigns is still slightly larger. We can say that May is a popular time to launch a crowdfunding campaign. 
The only time that the number of successful campaigns is almost the same as the number of failed campaigns is in December. With the fewest number of campaigns and half of them failed. 
The launch date of a campaign does not seem to have any correlation to its launch date. It seems very few campaigns are canceled regardless of month. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Looking at the data collected here, there are a higher percentage of campaigns below $5,000 and those between $35,000 and $40,000 that were successful than those between $9,999 and $35,000 or above $44,999. 
Campaigns abover $44,999 seem to be likely to fail. 



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A challenge that I had was that excel kept crashing on my computer. I ended up needing to restart the app and my computer a few time.
I also found that there was a lot of manual typing of the formulas, this could have been an issue as it would have been very easy to make a mistake while typinG. Double checking ones work, googling shortcuts and relying on the error messages propogated by excel can help negate these issues. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
        -The most common date to launch a kickstarter campaign is in the summer - May and June 
        -It is difficult to launch a successful kickstarter campaign in December

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
        - It is very difficult to launch a successful kickstarter campaign for a play with a goal fundraising amount above  $44,999 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
      -It was online information so there may be errors
      -While its a larger population set than 9, it still is a limited sample size
      -Not all of the campaigns are about plays
      -There are so many factors that go into a successful crowdfunding campaign. Social media strategy, pre-selected donors, exsitsting donor pools, how many people are working on and sharing the campaign, etc. While its interesting to look at launch date and goaled amount, it does not give a full picture of what makes a crowdfunding campaign successful. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-You will have to teach me.
