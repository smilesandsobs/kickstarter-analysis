# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This is an analysis of 4112 different kickstarter fundraising events around the work and how sucessful they were with relation to launch date and fundraising goals. 


### Purpose
The Purpose of this analysis is to provide Louise, who just recently completed an unsuccessful campaign for her play Fever, with information on how different campaigns have done so that she can use that information and plan accordingly.  

## Analysis and Challenges
We provided two analysis. 
One looking at how many sucessful/failed and canceled campains for plays there were during different months. 
Another looking at what percentage of campaigns were sucessful at different goaled amounts, from $1,000 to $50,000.

A challenge that I had was that excel kept crashing on my computer. I also found that there was a lot of manual typing, and it helped to try and google shortcuts. 



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the data and looking at the line point. There seems to be a large correlation of successful play campaigns launched in May. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
